# Blinky Example

For a detailed explanation on how to run the Blinky Example on the Alinx 7201 Board visit the wiki page of the project [here](https://github.com/chili-chips-ba/wireguard-fpga/wiki/2.Blinky-Example#blinky-example-project).

To simply run it on a Linux machine using scripts run the `run.sh` script located in the `3.build` folder, but change the Vivado installation path to your path in the script.
