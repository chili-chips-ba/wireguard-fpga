## WireGuard Test Scripts

Here are the scripts for testing certain functionalities of the complete build (HW + SW) and for debugging:
- `loopback.UART.py` - For loopback testing of the UART controller and peripheral hardware (CP2102), the script generates data blocks consisting of repeating characters Aâ€“Z and sends them over the serial port to the FPGA. Once the data is received back from the FPGA, it is compared with the originally sent data to verify correctness.
- `imwr.UART.py` - For replacing a single instruction in IMEM (as described in the [UART Data Flow](/1.hw/README.md#uart-data-flow)), the script sends the C_IMWR command followed by a 4-byte address and a 4-byte instruction. This allows precise modification of the program in real time without resetting the CPU.
- `busr.UART.py` - Used for reading data from the DMEM/CSR address space (as described in the [UART Data Flow](/1.hw/README.md#uart-data-flow)). Includes an example of reading the GPIO register.
- `busw.UART.py` - Used for writing data to the DMEM/CSR address space (as described in the [UART Data Flow](/1.hw/README.md#uart-data-flow)). Includes an example of writing to the GPIO register.
- `dump_packet.UART.py` - For reading an entire Ethernet packet (structure `eth_raw_packet_t`) from DMEM, including both hexadecimal and textual display of the payload.
